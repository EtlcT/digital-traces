About GDPR
GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulations, it has been created to protect data (personal data) privacy of European users
It has been published in 2016, before GDPR there were no common regulation in place inside EU about data ; in France a law already exists Loi informatique et libert√© that was created in 1978 but it was not sufficient.
Now the regulation must be followed by all European countries member's and so it is more easily applicable. It offers more rights to user on their personal data as right of rectification for exemple.
